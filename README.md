# Brownian-Motion-Numerical-Analysis

### Focus:

This project will focus on the application of Brownian Motion as a numerical method for stock market risk analysis.

### Data:

For this project the analysis of various stocks will be based on the collection of the data provided by teh yfinance API.

### Background:

I was interested in this problem because it seemed like I could apply something new which I had not learned before. I don’t have very much knowledge or experience when itcomes to the stock market, but I have always had an interest in learning more about it due
to its volatile and complex nature.

In this project I hope to be able to predict price movement, risk, and possibly compare multiple stocks in the short term or long term. To accomplish this I’m looking to employ time series analysis, an LSTM, or a Monte Carlo Simulation or some combination of
these to accomplish this.
